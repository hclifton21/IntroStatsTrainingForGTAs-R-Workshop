## Montana State University `R` Workshops Team

These materials were adapted from materials generated by the Data Carpentries (https://datacarpentry.org/) and were originally developed at MSU by Dr. Allison Theobold. The workshop series is co-organized by the Montana State University Library, Department of Mathematical Sciences, and Statistical Consulting and Research Services (SCRS, https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting/). SCRS is supported by Montana INBRE (National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences Grant Number P20GM103474). The workshops for 2021-2022 are supported by Faculty Excellence Grants from MSU's Center for Faculty Excellence. 

Research related to the development of these workshops is to appear in:

* Theobold, A., Hancock, S., & Mannheimer, S.. Data Science Workshops for Data-Intensive Environmental Science Research, _Journal of Statistics Education_. 

The workshops for 2021-2022 involve modifications of materials and are licensed CC-BY. ![Creative Commons License](88x31.png) This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

The workshops for 2021-2022 involve modifications of materials and are being taught by:

### Sara Mannheimer

* Sara Mannheimer is an Associate Professor and Data Librarian at Montana State University, where she helps shape practices and theories for curation, publication, and preservation of data. Her research examines the social, ethical, and technical issues of a data-driven world. She is the project lead for the MSU Dataset Search, and she is working on a book about data curation to support responsible qualitative data reuse and big social research.

### Greta Linse

* Greta Linse is the Interim Director of Statistical Consulting and Research Services (https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting/) and the Project Manager for the Human Ecology Learning and Problem Solving (HELPS) Lab (https://helpslab.montana.edu). Greta has been teaching, documenting and working with statistical software including R and RStudio for over 10 years.


### Harley Clifton

* Harley Clifton is an undergraduate senior pursuing a degree in Mathematics (Statistics Option) with a minor in Psychology. She enjoys teaching nuanced coding skills and Data Visualization strategies through her experience as a Teaching Assistant for STAT 216 and STAT 408. Harley recently attended the Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Undergraduate Data Science at the University of California Irvine, funded by the National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (under Award Number R25AI170491). Her areas of interest include quantifying behaviors and societal attitudes, behavior modification to reduce discrimination, Deaf culture and history, and womenâ€™s health.

### Eliot Liucci


* Eliot Liucci is a senior in the Mathematics (Statistics Option) here at Montana State University. He works in the Mathematics Statistics Center and has been a Teaching Assistant for STAT 216 and STAT 217. He hopes to move into Data Analysis and Education in order to help streamline the way Statistics is taught to students and will start the M.S. in Statistics program in Spring 2023.

### Mark Greenwood

* Mark Greenwood is a Professor of Statistics in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Montana State University and the former Director of Statistical Consulting and Research Services (https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting/). His research interests have involved statistical methods and applications in environmental sciences, education, and biological sciences. Recent work has involved researching diagnostic methods for Multiple Sclerosis. His current research grants include funding from the Mountain West IDeA Clinical and Translational Research - Infrastructure Network  (National Institute of General Medical Sciences Grant 5U54GM104944-08) and a grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (RG-1907-34348).
