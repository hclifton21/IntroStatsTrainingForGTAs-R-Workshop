## Getting a Feel for the Class and Your Role

Congratulations on becoming a STAT 216 Teaching Assistant! You may know this from your personal experience if you took STAT 216 at Montana State University, but Teaching Assistants can make a world of difference to students.

Some students, especially college freshman, may feel intimidated with contacting a professor directly for help. That's where you come in! Your role as TA's consists of aiding students in gaining a nuanced understanding of introductory statistical methods, giving students real-time feedback, and troubleshooting any coding issues that arise.

A large part of your position is to maintain communication between the students and lead instructors. If you see a common issues arising, be sure to communicate this to your lead instructor so they can get everyone on the same page and clear up any misconceptions.

### STAT 216 Course Materials

Students will be required to purchase a **Coursepack** which will contain the activities and labs they will work through and complete over the course of the semester. This will be available for them to purchase at the MSU Bookstore.

There is also a **Textbook** for the course. Note: **The course textbook is NOT** the same thing as the coursepack! Many students confuse this, especially early on. Students can access a free copy of the STAT 216 Textbook online. They can find this by going to the [STAT 216 Course page](https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/) on montana.edu, through a link posted on D2L, or through a link on the [STAT 216 Syllabus](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/SummerSyllabus/) which is located under *Course Materials and Resources*. Here is a direct link to the [Online Textbook](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/) as well.

The **activities** and **labs** in the coursepack with often require students to use an RScript file to complete. This R Bootcamp is meant to help you get a better understand of coding in `R` so you can help students when they run into issues.

### Other Resources Available

There are a variety of other resources available for STAT 216 Students:

**1. The Mathematics and Statistics Center (MSC)**

The MSC is located on the same floor in Romney that the STAT 216 classes are held, so you can't miss it. There are always in-house tutors available that can help students with statistics. Students automatically have access to the MSC through enrolling in STAT 216, and can enter for free by swiping their CatCard. The MSC has the activity solutions so students can check their work and get more in-depth feedback by looking through them.

**2. SmartyCats Tutoring**

If you aren't already aware, there are SmartyCats Tutors available for a wide variety of MSU classes. The majority of tutors have taken the courses before and have a good idea of the instructors expectations. Tutoring Session only cost \$2 a piece, which mean they are very affordable for most students.

**3. Other Tutoring Opportunities**

There are multiple private tutors as well! There is a bulletin board in the Wilson building where student tutors post their contact information. Since Wilson is a maze and finding the bulletin board can be intimating, students can also reach out to the math department through email as well.

If a student is a Veteran or is using a relative's Military Educational Benefits to help pay for school, there are free statistics tutors available to them through the Veterans Center on Campus. The Veterans Support Center is also located in Romney, but on the first floor.

**4. Stack Overflow**

If you run in to issues when running through the code files prior to class, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a good resource to help you troubleshoot in 'R' when you do not have your lead instructor available to ask. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to R

Coding can be very intimidating, especially for students with no prior coding experience. Thus, the `R` script files accompanying activities and labs require pretty minimal amount of alterations by the students. Students will be expected to gradually contribute more in `R`, but are not expected to be expert coders at any point during the course.

In order to get started with `R` and `RStudio`, it will be beneficial to understand the User Interface. `RStudio` has the following layout:

-   the **Editor** for your scripts and documents (top-left)\
-   the `R` **Console** (bottom-left)\
-   your **Environment (Objects/Variables)/History** (top-right)\
-   and your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right).

![RStudio layout](rstudio.png)

The color scheme of `RStudio` can also be changed by going to **Tools --\> Global Options --\> Appearance**. This can make the long days of coding a lot easier on the eyes. Another way to personalize `RStudio` is to change the pane layout. This can be done in **Tools --\> Global Options --\> Pane Layout**.

Now that `RStudio` is personalized to your specifications, we can start diving into the basics of coding with `R`. One of the most useful concepts is to store values as a variable. This can be done using an arrow `<-` as shown below. It is important to note that this only goes one direction.

```{r}
x <- 7
```

We can then check the value of our variable by simply typing the name of the variable.

```{r practice1, exercise = T}
x
```

We can also use `R` to do math. This can be combined with variables to do some fun stuff.

```{r}
x + x * x
```

Similarly to how we store values as a variable, we can do the same with vectors or even whole data sets! To store a vector as a variable, write the vector inside of `c()` to let `R` know you have a list of values. Vectors can be letters, numbers, or a combination of the two.

```{r}
My_List <- c(1, 2, 'lettuce', 4, 'tomato')
```

To store a dataset in `R`, we can do something similar. However, we must also include the function `read_csv()` from the `tidyverse` package. We can do this to read a .csv file (Comma Separated Values) into the environment window in `R`.

```{r}
RollerCoasters <- read_csv('RollerCoasters.csv')
```

When this is done, we can see some information show up in the Console. We see how many rows and columns the dataset has as well as the variables and their type. Variables can either be 'double' if they are numbers of 'character' if they are words.

Each row in this particular dataset holds information for a single roller coaster, and the columns represent:

| Column            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Age_Group         | 1:Older (1900-1979), 2:1Recent (1980-1999), 3:Newest (200-Current)          |
| Coaster           | Name of the roller coaster                                                  |
| Park              | Name of the park where the roller coaster is located                        |
| City              | City where the roller coaster is located                                    |
| State             | State where the roller coaster if located                                   |
| Type              | Material of track (Steel or Wooden)                                         |
| Design            | How a passenger is positioned in the roller coaster                         |
| Year_Opened       | Year when the roller coaster opened                                         |
| Top_Speed         | Maximum speed of the roller coaster (mph)                                   |
| Max_Height        | Highest point of the roller coaster (ft)                                    |
| Drop              | Length of largest gap between hgih and low points of roller coaster (ft)    |
| Length            | Length of the roller coaster track (ft)                                     |
| Duration          | Time length of roller coaster ride (sec)                                    |
| Inversions        | Whether or not the roller coaster flips passengers at any point (Yes or No) |
| Num_of_Inversions | Number of times the roller coaster flips passengers                         |

### Importing a Dataset using the Drop-Down Menu

However, students will often have to upload the dataset .csv file to the server ***using the drop down menu*** before `R` can read it in like above.


-----> write more instructions on how to do this *****


### Viewing the Dataset

Once the dataset is imported into the RStudio Server, it can be viewed by clicking on the **Environment tab** in the upper right corner of the server and double clicking the dataset you want to view. The dataset will be opened in the upper left corner of the server, allowing you to see all the variables and how their names are formatted! The formatting of variable names is very important when coding, and often is the source of early mistakes in STAT 216.

If we want to get a summary of only a certain set of rows or columns from a dataset, we can write `[row,column]` after the dataset to get a subset of the data frame. The `View()` function can also be helpful to view the entire dataset by typing the following into the **Console**: View(RollerCoasters) 

```{r practice2, exercise = T}
RollerCoasters[1:5,]
```

The code above is providing rows 1 through 5 of the `RollerCoasters` dataset.

We can also run functions on vectors, like `mean()` or `summary()`, that allow us to determine key information.

```{r}
Counting <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

mean(Counting)

summary(Counting)
```

Another important component to `R` is commenting on code without affecting the code itself. This can be done by typing a pound symbol `#` before the comment.

```{r}
2 + 2 #Look at how well R can add!
```

Comments do not need to be ran for the code to work. However, it is good practice to good documentation of your code through comments so others can easily understand it. Comments can exist on a line alone, after a line with a section of a function, but cannot exist between code on the same line.

### Now You Try!

#### Exercise 1

**Write code in the following code chunk that calculates the mean of a list from 1 to 100 (Hint: You can put `:` between numbers to let `R` know you want a list from the first number to the second).**

```{r Intro-To-R-Exercise-1, exercise=T}

```

#### Exercise 2

**Write code to print out the 5th and 18th rows from the `RollerCoasters` dataset.**

```{r Intro-To-R-Exercise-2,exercise=T}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Navigating the RStudio Server

### Where to Access it

Students will have multiple modes of accessing the `RStudio` Server.

One option is to go through [Montana State University Webpage](montana.edu), search "rstudio server", and click the [login link](https://rstudio.math.montana.edu/).

Students will also have a link available to them within the STAT 216 page in D2L.

The `Rstudio` Server can also be accessed through the [Syllabus](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/SummerSyllabus/) under Course Materials and Resources -\> RStudio.

Once students are directed to the RStudio Server, they will then be prompted to **Sign in** using their **MSU NetID and password** - this will be the same login information they use to access D2L.

### R is Case-Sensitive

You may have heard this if you took STAT 216 at MSU, but what does this really mean?

Essentially, `R` is not always very smart. It matters whether words are capitalized or lowercase when storing or calling a dataset, variables, or functions.

For example, if you are trying to use a variable named "Year" but accidentally type "year" with a lowercase "y", `R` will not recognize or understand what you are trying to reference.

#### Excercise 3

**Referencing the Dataset above, can you find and correct the mistake? (Hint: remember that `R` is case-sensitive!)**

```{r Server-Exercise-3, exercise=T}

```

### Using Packages

What is a Package in `R`? According to [TutorialsPoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_packages.htm):

*"R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data. They are stored under a directory called* library *in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages during installation. More packages are added later, when they are needed for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, only the default packages are available by default. Other packages which are already installed have to be loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that is going to use them."*

When working with packages, there are two different steps.

-   First, a package must be installed onto the `RStudio` server. This step only needs to be done once.

-   Second, you must library the package to use any of the functions in it. This must be done each time a new session in the 'RStudio' server is started.

Here is an analogy that has been extremely helpful when explaining why students must run the `library( )` codes first whenever they open an `R` script file:

![Library Packages](RInstallvsLibrary.jpeg)

### Importing and Exporting Files within the Server




------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plotting with ggplot

### What is ggplot?

`ggplot` is a layer-based way of creating graphs within the `tidyverse` package. The main benefit of it over typical graphing code is that it allows us to build on a graph to make it as complex as we would like. Let's take a look at some examples and build them up as we go. For this, we will be working with the `RollerCoasters` data set.

```{r warning=F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters)

## Creates a blank ggplot(), referencing the RollerCoasters dataset
```

We can see that this code simply creates a blank graph. This is because we have not specified what variables we would like to use. Let's take a look at the relationship between the year that the coaster was opened and its top speed.

To accomplish this, we can define a mapping (using the aesthetic (`aes`) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

```{r warning=F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Year_Opened, y = Top_Speed))

# Creates a blank ggplot(), with the variables mapped to the x- and y-axis
# ggplot() knows where the variables live, since you have defined the data to use
```

Now we can see that the variables of interest are on our graph, but the data itself is still absent. That is because we have not specified a way for the data to be presented. There are several ways to do this, the most common of which are as follows:

      * `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
      * `geom_boxplot()` for boxplots   
      * `geom_bar()` for bar charts 
      * `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.  

For this example, lets create a scatter plot. We can do this by adding the `geom_point` argument to our graph. Note that for each layer that is added on, we must seperate the lines with a plus (+).

```{r warning=F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Year_Opened, y = Top_Speed)) +
  geom_point()

 # Adds a point for each row (observation) in the data 
```

If we wanted to color all of the points the same color, we can put the `color =` argument in the `geom_point()` layer.

```{r warning=F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Year_Opened, y = Top_Speed)) +
  geom_point(color = 'blue')

# Colors the all of the points in the plot blue
```

If we wanted to add a categorical variable to this graph, we could tell `R` to color the points based on that variable. For the next graph, lets color the points based on the roller coaster `Type`. This will be added into the `aes()` section as it is a variable associated with an aesthetic of our graph.

```{r warning=F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Year_Opened, y = Top_Speed, color = Type)) +
  geom_point()

# Colors points in the plot by coaster Type
# Notice how it automatically adds a legend to the plot! How Nice is that?!
```

### Troubleshooting Common ggplot2 Coding Issues

One of the most common issues that can come up when working with `ggplot` is data sets being mispelled. Let's take a look at what this looks like. Additionally, try to correct the error.

```{r ggplot-troubleshooting-1, exercise = T, warning = F}
ggplot(data = Rollercoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Design, y = Top_Speed)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

The next most common is the + being in the incorrect spot in the code. The + must be placed at the end of a line rather than at the beginning of a new one. Let's take a look at an example of this. Additionally, try to correct the error.

```{r ggplot-troubleshooting-2, exercise = T, warning = F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Year_Opened))
  + geom_histogram()
```

Another very common error is when a set of parenthesis is opened, but never closed. One way to avoid this is to turn on "Rainbow Parenthesis" by going to Tools --\> Global Options --\> Code --\> Display --\> Rainbow Parenthesis.

However, it is still possible for stray parenthesis to be involved in code. Let's take a look at an example of this. Fix the code by adding or removing parenthesis.

```{r ggplot-troubleshooting-3, exercise = T, warning = F}
ggplot(data = RollerCoasters,
       mapping = aes(x = Duration, y = Length))) +
  geom_point()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using catstats

### What is catstats?

`catstats` is a package containing useful functions and data that is designed for the STAT 216 and STAT 217 courses at Montana State University. For more information, visit the [github repository for catstats](https://github.com/greenwood-stat/catstats).

### Installing catstats

If you are running `RStudio` locally rather than from the server, you must install `catstats`. This can be done by first installing the `remotes` package, which allows us to install packages from github repositories. See the code chunk below for installing `remotes`.

```{r remotes-installation, eval=F}
install.packages("remotes")
```

Once `remotes` is installed, we can install `catstats` using the code below.

```{r catstats-installation, eval=F}
remotes::install_github("greenwood-stat/catstats")
```

### Troubleshooting Common Catstats Coding Issues

One of the first issues that you may run into is if a student tries to install `catstats` without `remotes` being installed. You may get an error code that says something along the lines of **Error in \_\_\_\_\_ : could not find function "remotes"**.

Another common error may be **Error: Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub**. This likely means that there is a spelling error in the path within the `install_github` function.

`catstats` was designed with errors in mind. That is to say that if an error is caused, there will likely be a message that appears in the Console window that lets the student know what might be the problem. Make sure students are always checking spelling and error codes if they are having issues.

### Now You Try!

#### Exercise \_\_

**Fix the following code.**

```{r catstats-exercise-1, exercise=T}
one_proportion_test(
  probability_success = 50,
  sample_size = 10,
  summary_measure = "proportion",
  direction = "greater",
  as_extreme_as = 0.6,
  number_repetitions = 20
)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coding Expectations for Students

As mentioned previously, the level of coding ability expected of students is very minimal. Therefore, students will only need to alter a few key areas in the code files that were created to accompany the activities and labs.

### Recurrent phrases and words that students will need to find and *replace*:

-   "**datasetname**" : Students should replace this phrase with the name of the dataset _exactly_ how it appears in the Environment window.

-   "**variable**" : This one is pretty straight forward. When only dealing with one variable of interest, this is where the should put the name of the variable, _making sure to replicate how it appears in the dataset_. Pay attention to Capitalization and lowercase, underscores, and other potentially tricky formatting with variable names.

-   "**explanatory**" & "**response**" : Students will need to identify and correctly enter the variable names as they appear in the dataset. Sometimes, if they identify them incorrectly or switch them, output may be incorrect or the code my not run altogether.

-   "**xx**" : Further into the semester, this phrase will pop up often. Usually, students are expected to replace this with a numeric value, variable name, or level of a variable. To discern which is expected, a comment with almost always follow on the same line of code and describe exactly what should be entered there.

**Note**: students will often need to _replace_ these phrases, not type the answer next to it! When replacing a word or phrase, often students will accidentally delete quotation marks, commmas, or parentheses that are necessary for the function to run correctly. You will be expected to be able to look at catstats functions and ggplot code, assess what is incorrect or missing, and fix the issue.

### Common Mistakes include:

**A**. Replacing the word, or 'call', that the functions will use to reference the dataset instead of the word 'datasetname'. The actually name of the uploaded dataset, which will usually be read in from a text file or .csv file, will appear in the Environment and **must be typed exactly how it appears there** or else `R` will not recognize it.

---insert example of give code with no edits

---insert example of the mistake

**B**. Not running the `library( )` codes **prior** to attempting to run other code. This is a good time to bring up that handy light bulb metaphor from before. Students must run these each time a new session in the RStudio Server is started.

**C**. Students may trying to **run functions before reading in the dataset**. The dataset code must be edited correctly and run for 'R' to know what it is referencing and what variable names it is dealing with.

**D**. ___NOT Reading!___ You'd think that by the time someone has been accepted into college, the would probably know how to read. However, knowing how to and actually doing so are two completely separate things. Many exercises will be presented to the students like this:

```{r}

```

Notice how there is a comment to the right of each line in the code **explicitly telling the student what to replace the corresponding key phrase with**. Despite this, students may call you over to ask what they should replace the phrase with anyway. Just a word of advice, this can get very repetitive so it may be wise to give them some slack early on but still point out where they can find the answer on their own.

**E**. Accidentally deleting quotation marks or commas after an argument within a function. If you are unsure if this has occurred, don't hesitate to ask the student to open another unedited version of the same file under a different name (so it doesn't overide all of the edits and progress they have made on their current R file) to double check that area of the template code.

### Errors vs. Warning Messages

Another good thing to note while working in 'R', and especially when working with the `catstats` package and its functions, **an Error message is *NOT* the same a a Warning message**. An Error prevents the highlighted code from running altogether, while a warning will still run the code but bring important notes to the users attention. Students may occasionally call you over and ask why they are getting a red message, assuming it means an error has occurred, when the are actually just seeing a warning message built into a function and it is completely possible that they have done nothing wrong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advice from Former STAT 216/217 TA's for a Successful Semester

-   ***Make sure Students are Aware of their resources EARLY in the semester.*** The beginning of the semester can be a bit overwhelming for everyone, so they may have trouble remembering all of the resources available to them. If a students begins to struggle with the material, it can be very discouraging if they are unaware of where to go for help. Don't hesitate to reiterate where they can find resources, even if you think you may be getting pretty repetitive. This also allows you to start the semester on the right foot, and students will understand that you care about their success.

-   ***Review the activity/lab for the day prior to coming to class!*** There is limited time when students can get real time feedback from the instruction team, so it is crucial that you do not waste extra time during the class period getting familiar with the dataset or assignment questions. This is especially important if you did not take STAT 216 at MSU.

-   ***Run through the code before the class period.*** Chances are, if you (the TA's) run into an error, the students are very likely to run into it as well. If it can be caught early, it allows for a chance to fix any errors in the code and/or discussion of how to handle the road block when students encounter it.

-   ***Know how to Navigate any Applet that will be used.*** Accessing the Applets, navigating the applets, and seeing the big picture are common areas where students may run into trouble during class. Come to class knowing how to use the relevant Applet for the activity and be prepared to help when students get stuck!

-   ***Be prepared for students to ask you lots of questions!*** As mentioned before, freshmen often feel more comfortable asking a fellow student or TA their questions. Nobody enjoys being belittled for asking questions, so try to encourage them when they do. Additionally, don't be afraid to admit if you are unsure about something and call your lead instructor over to help.

-   ***Attend the Weekly Meetings with your lead instructor as often as possible.*** This is a great time to touch base with your team, communicate any subjects that are particularly challenging, and prepare for upcoming activities and labs.

-   ***Balance Validation and Instruction in your interactions.*** It is inevitable that poorly worded or unclear questions will occasionally arise. I (Harley) have found it helpful to validate student's frustrations and then guide them in the right direction. As TA's, we are not here to do their work for them or give them answers. We are here to help them learn the material. When a difficult question arises, validating their feelings is encouraging but must also be balanced with instruction. Nobody is happy if one student airing their grievances takes time away from you helping another student.

Most importantly, don't be afraid to ask questions yourself and learn things alongside the students! Communication and effort go a long way, regardless of the situation. 

Luckily, this information will always be here for you to reference if you have any specific questions or just want a quick refresher.

We all wish you good luck and a successful semester! :)
