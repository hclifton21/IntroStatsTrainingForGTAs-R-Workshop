## General (harley write a better title but brain no work now)

Congratulations on becoming a STAT 216 Teaching Assistant! You may know this from your personal experience if you took STAT 216 at Montana State University, but Teaching Assistants can make a world of difference to students. 

Some students, especially college freshman, may feel intimidated with contacting a professor directly for help. That's where you come in! Your role as TA's consists of aiding students in gaining a nuanced understanding of introductory statistical methods, giving students real-time feedback, and troubleshooting any coding issues that arise. 

A large part of your position is to maintain communication between the students and lead instructors. If you see a common issues arising, be sure to communicate this to your lead instructor so they can get everyone on the same page and clear up any misconceptions.

### Advice from Former STAT 216/217 TA's for a Successful Semester

* ___Review the activity/lab for the day **prior** to coming to class!___ There is limited time when students can get real time feedback from the instruction team, so it is crucial that you do not waste extra time during the class period getting familiar with the dataset or assignment questions. This is especialy important if you did not take STAT 216 at MSU.

* ___Run through the code before the class period.___ Chances are, if you (the TA's) run into an error, the students are very likely to run into it as well. If it can be caught early, it allows for a chance to fix any errors in the code and/or discussion of how to handle the road block when students encounter it.

* ___Attend the Weekly Meetings with your lead instructor as often as possible.___ This is a great 

* ___Be prepared for students to ask you lots of questions!___ As mentioned before, freshmen often feel more comfortable asking a fellow student or TA their questions. Nobody enjoys being belittled for asking questions, so try to encourage them when they do. Additionally, don't be afraid to admit if you are unsure about something and call your lead instructor over to help.

## Introduction to R

In order to get started with `R` and `RStudio`, it will be beneficial to understand the User Interface. `RStudio` has the following layout:

-   the **Editor** for your scripts and documents (top-left)\
-   the `R` **Console** (bottom-left)\
-   your **Environment (Objects/Variables)/History** (top-right)\
-   and your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right).

![RStudio layout](rstudio.png)

The color scheme of `RStudio` can also be changed by going to **Tools --> Global Options --> Appearance**. This can make the long days of coding a lot easier on the eyes. Another way to personalize `RStudio` is to change the pane layout. This can be done in **Tools --> Global Options --> Pane Layout**.

Now that `RStudio` is personalized to your specifications, we can start diving into the basics of coding with `R`. One of the most useful concepts is to store values as a variable. This can be done using an arrow `<-` as shown below.

```{r}
x <- 7
```

We can then check the value of our variable by simply typing the name of the variable.

```{r}
x
```


We can also use `R` to do math. This can be combined with variables to do some fun stuff.

```{r}
x + x * x
```

Similarly to how we store values as a variable, we can do the same with vectors or even whole data sets! To store a vector as a variable, write the vector inside of `c()` to let `R` know you have a list of values. Vectors can be letters, numbers, or a combination of the two.

```{r}
My_List <- c(1, 2, 'lettuce', 4, 'tomato')
```

To store a dataset in `R`, we can do something similar. However, we must also include the function `read_csv()` from the `tidyverse` package. We can do this to read a .csv file (Comma Separated Values) into the environment window in `R`.

```{r}
RollerCoasters <- read_csv('RollerCoasters.csv')
```

When this is done, we can see some information show up in the Console. We see how many rows and columns the dataset has as well as the variables and their type. Variables can either be 'double' if they are numbers of 'character' if they are words.

## Navigating the RStudio Server


### Where to Access it

Students will have multiple modes of accessing the 'RStudio' Server.

One option is to go through [Montana State University Webpage](montana.edu), search "rstudio server", and click the [login link](https://rstudio.math.montana.edu/).

Students will also have a link available to them within the STAT 216 page in D2L. 

The 'Rstudio' Server can also be accessed through the [Syllabus](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/SummerSyllabus/) under Course Materials and Resources -> RStudio.

## Montana State University `R` Workshops Team

These materials were adapted from materials generated by the Data Carpentries (<https://datacarpentry.org/>) and were originally developed at MSU by Dr. Allison Theobold. The workshop series is co-organized by the Montana State University Library, Department of Mathematical Sciences, and Statistical Consulting and Research Services (SCRS, <https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting/>). SCRS is supported by Montana INBRE (National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences Grant Number P20GM103474). The workshops for 2021-2022 are supported by Faculty Excellence Grants from MSU's Center for Faculty Excellence.
